   <br>This audio is the start of the player's adventure into what one could see as a metroidvania. On the outside it does, but the 
    audio starts off calm. Rather than rushed and quick. The audio can be interpreted as the "calm before the storm".</b>

<br> The opening music of the game gives off the emotions of uneasiness, but also a bit of interest. Giving us an interesting start to the game. As if to almost mirror ourselfs, coming into this unknown area of experience. <br/>

<br> While this snapshot of this level is further in the game than at the shown video. We can see the contrast of colors, giving off a sense of warmth, but also a stark difference in "cold" colors. Overall this game is trying to blend the anxiety of doing something that is needed to be done. And the peaks of comfort with the warm colors. Shining through to share with the player that you're doing great by persisiting. Even in the "cold" times of uneasiness and uncertainty. <br/>
