   <br>This audio is the start of the player's adventure into what one could see as a metroidvania. On the outside it does, but the 
    audio starts off calm. Rather than rushed and quick. The audio can be interpreted as the "calm before the storm".</b>

<br> the opening music of the game gives off the emotions of uneasiness, but also a bit of interest. Giving us an interesting start to the game. As if to almost mirror ourselfs, coming into this unknown area of experience. <br/>
